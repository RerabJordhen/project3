      <p>
        Basketball is a game played between two teams of five players each on a
        rectangular court, usually indoors. Each team tries to score by tossing
        the ball through the opponent's goal, an elevated horizontal hoop and
        net called a basket.

          Playing basketball helps to improve motor coordination, flexibility,
          and endurance. It also encourages speed, agility, and strength. These
          skills are shown to have a positive effect on promoting a healthy body
          weight and encouraging more physical activity, which can enhance
          cardiorespiratory fitness and self-esteem.

              <h3>Always in love with basketball.</h3>
              <p>Basketball was invented by James Naismith in Springfield, Massachusetts, in 1891. Within a few decades, the new game became popular throughout the United States as an indoor sport. The popularity spread overseas and the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) was organized in 1932 in Geneva, Switzerland.

                Thanks in part to the effort of Phog Allen[46][47]—a Kansas Jayhawks collegiate coach—the first Olympic basketball tournament was organized in the 1936 Berlin Olympics on outdoor tennis courts. Dr. Naismith presented the medals to the top three teams. According to the Olympic rules of that time, all of the competitors were amateurs. The tournament was held indoors for the first time in 1948. The American team proved its dominance, winning the first seven Olympic tournaments through 1968, without losing a single game. While the Americans were barred from sending a team that contained players from the professional National Basketball Association, they instead sent in college players; teams from some other countries sent in their best players, as some of their players were classified as "amateur" by FIBA, by earning allowances instead of wages.</p>
              <p>The U.S. winning streak ended in 1972 in one of the most controversial matches in history, when the Soviet Union beat them in the gold-medal game by one point.

                The U.S. team reclaimed the gold medal in 1976, with Yugoslavia, which had beaten the Soviet Union in the semifinal, finishing runner-up for the second time. In 1980, with the Americans' absence due to the boycott, Yugoslavia became the third team to win the title, after beating the Soviets anew in the semifinals and Italy in the final.</p>
      
              <p>The Americans regained the title in 1984, by beating Spain in the final, with the Soviets boycotting this time. The Soviets won the gold medal for the second time in 1988, after beating the U.S. team for the second time in the semifinal, and the Yugoslavs in the gold medal game.</p>
